But many are wrong labeled and arranged

## initial state
* [finance, global, ...]_titles_w_label.txt
## arrange.py
* [0, 1, 2, ...].txt
* collect each label titles
## correct labels
* [0b, 1c, 2b, ...].txt 
## recover label files in each subject
* [finance, global, ...]_titles_w_labelb.txt

## copy selected files in 
* {subject}_titles_w_label2.txt
